# What is YACS?

YACS was created with the goal of making students' lives a little easier. It allows users to avoid the often clunky UIs of proprietary Catalog Management and Student Information Systems by enabling easy browsing and searching of courses, and adds the additional functionality of easy schedule generation.

YACS is capable of aggregating academic data stored across multiple proprietary systems, including course offerings, section meeting times, and seat availability. This data then is presented to users in a searchable, browesable form.

Most importantly, YACS leverages meeting time data to provide students with an easy way to plan their semesters. Students need only select the courses and sections they would like to take, and are given a list of all valid schedule variants based on their selections. Schedules are presented in a weekly-calendar view, and are easily downloadable and shareable.

All of this functionality is exposed through a public REST API, making it easy to create exciting new applications and extensions that leverage the data YACS provides.

YACS is primarily developed within [RCOS, the Rensselaer Center for Open Source](https://rcos.io), an amazing organization at RPI that aims to facilitate open source education and solve societal problems. However, other developers and universities are strongly encouraged to contribute to and influence the direction of this project.

Visit [our blog](https://yacs-rcos.github.io/), [pull requests](https://github.com/YACS-RCOS/yacs/pulls), and [issues page](https://github.com/YACS-RCOS/yacs/issues) for development updates and information.

# API
